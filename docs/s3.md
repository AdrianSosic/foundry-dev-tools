# S3 compatible dataset API

Palantir Foundry released a beta for a S3 compatible dataset API. Which lets you use the aws cli, boto3 and other s3 compatible libraries.
As the authentication via a JWT does not work directly, but needs another API call inbetween, we created these methods and the cli to get you easily started with the API.


## CLI

### Init

For the AWS cli, we needed to create a profile in your config, which dynamically hands over the S3 credentials to the cli.

To create this profile in your config run:

```zsh
fdt s3 init
```

This will do the following things:

1. Read your current aws config file, if it does not exist, it will create one
2. Add the foundry profile programmatically, which uses the `credential_config` option to call the `fdt s3 auth` cli.
3. Show a diff to the previous config and create a backup of the old config, if a change was made.

After running the command, please check the diff and your aws config file,
you can always recover the config via the backup file, the path to the backup will be printed, and is in the same directory as your aws config.

### Auth

```zsh
fdt s3 auth
```

The auth command gets used by the configuration profile as mentioned above, it adheres to the output schema defined at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html


## Methods you can use in python

- [FoundryRestClient.get_s3_client](#foundry_dev_tools.foundry_api_client.FoundryRestClient.get_s3_client)
- [FoundryRestClient.get_s3_resource](#foundry_dev_tools.foundry_api_client.FoundryRestClient.get_s3_resource)
- [FoundryRestClient.get_s3fs_storage_options](#foundry_dev_tools.foundry_api_client.FoundryRestClient.get_s3fs_storage_options)
- [FoundryRestClient.get_s3_polars_storage_options](#foundry_dev_tools.foundry_api_client.FoundryRestClient.get_s3_polars_storage_options)

### Examples

#### S3Client

```python
from foundry_dev_tools import FoundryRestClient

fc = FoundryRestClient()
s3_client = fc.get_s3_client()
s3_client.list_objects(
    Bucket="ri.foundry.main.dataset.2ce7cb50-41f3-4e22-a6b7-ae4deaf3985e",
)  # replace with a dataset RID of yours
```

#### S3Resource

```python
from foundry_dev_tools import FoundryRestClient

fc = FoundryRestClient()
s3_client = fc.get_s3_client()
s3_client.list_objects(
    Bucket="ri.foundry.main.dataset.2ce7cb50-41f3-4e22-a6b7-ae4deaf3985e",
)  # replace with a dataset RID of yours
```

#### Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd
from foundry_dev_tools import FoundryRestClient

fc = FoundryRestClient()
storage_options = fc.get_s3_storage_options()
df = pd.read_parquet(
    "s3://ri.foundry.main.dataset.2ce7cb50-41f3-4e22-a6b7-ae4deaf3985e/spark",
    storage_options=storage_options,
)  # replace with a dataset RID of yours, should be a dataset with parquet files

print(df)
```

#### fsspec

```python
import fsspec
from foundry_dev_tools import FoundryRestClient

fc = FoundryRestClient()
dataset_rid = "ri.foundry.main.dataset.2ce6cb10-59f4-4e19-a3b8-ae3deaf5985e"
with fsspec.open(f"s3://{dataset_rid}/test.csv", "r", **fc.get_s3fs_storage_options()) as f:
    print(f.read())

# -------------------

fs = fsspec.filesystem("s3", **fc.get_s3fs_storage_options())
with fs.open(f"{dataset_rid}/fsspec_test_write.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("hihi")
with fs.open(f"{dataset_rid}/fsspec_test_write.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
